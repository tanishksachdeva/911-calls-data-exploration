# 911-calls-data-exploration
For this project we will be analyzing some 911 call data from Kaggle , here we will be focusing on data exploration as well as diving into the visualizations as promised. We will be using one of my favourite libraries Seaborn. The main aim of this project is to sample the data set, and get close to the details in the dataset. The data contains the following fields:
lat : String variable, Latitude
lng: String variable, Longitude
desc: String variable, Description of the Emergency Call
zip: String variable, Zipcode
title: String variable, Title
timeStamp: String variable, YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
twp: String variable, Township
addr: String variable, Address
e: String variable, Dummy variable (always 1)
